# Gitea-RSS
To change the script to personalize it (change username, git site, update interval, number of posts), make sure to edit lines 4, 5, 8, and 11 of `rss.sh`.\
My goal with this project is to bring general user activity to RSS feed readers. Other sites let you make feeds for issue trackers and repo commits, but none let you make a feed for all user activity shown on a user profile. Hence, this project.

## Dependencies
curl, lftp
